# cpp_coursework
repo for my alison.com c++ exercises

Started with https://alison.com/course/introduction-to-c-plus-plus-programming as a refresher.
Made a hello world (hw.cpp) program mostly so I could figure out how I was going to compile and run.

Modules 1 & 2 were mostly things identical with C; the only new things were the block syntax for initializing variables, i.e.:
int i{ 4 };
the concept of namespaces, and the introduction of the std::string class.
