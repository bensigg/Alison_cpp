# cpp_coursework
repo for my alison.com c++ exercises

Started with https://alison.com/course/introduction-to-c-plus-plus-programming as a refresher course.
Made a hello world (hw.cpp) program mostly so I could figure out how I was going to compile and run it.

Modules 1 & 2 were mostly things identical with C. They introduced a block syntax for initializing variables I hadn't seen before:
int i{ 4 };
but the g++ command-line compiler doesn't seem to like it.

I spent some time testing the limits of the overloaded operators and indexing operations of the std::string class; see stringtests.cpp.
